    <h1>My Hobbies :)</h1>
    <hr />
    <ul>
        <li><h2>Music<h2 /></li>
            I am very passionate about Music as a subject and spend at least an hour daily with a combination of
             playing guitar, piano, studying music theory and composing.
        <li><h2>Software Development</h2></li>
            I have a lot of fun playing around with python and making little apps, games and software.

        <li><h2>Videogames</h2></li>
            I am a big gaming nerd, and although this occupies less of my time nowadays, I still love to 
            play videogames and get excited for new releases.
        <li><h2>Studying</h2></li>
            I get a lot of joy out of learning something new, especially when it is a useful skill or craft.
